## Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App. This is meant to be a simple Web App which I made to further my programming skills. 

It is particularly focused on using APIs to get information, in this case about the forecast for a given city. For that I used Foreca API (https://rapidapi.com/foreca-ltd-foreca-ltd-default/api/foreca-weather)
and Forward and Reverse Geocoding Api from Rapid API (https://rapidapi.com/GeocodeSupport/api/forward-reverse-geocoding/).

I also made it using Typescript in an attempt to improve my knowledge of this language and of Javascript concepts in general.

Update: I added the React framework and refactored the code.
