Welcome to my Weather App. This is meant to be a simple Web App which I made to further my programming skills. 

It is particularly focused on using APIs to get information, in this case about the forecast for a given city. For that I used 7timer API (http://www.7timer.info/doc.php)
and Forward and Reverse Geocoding Api from Rapid API (https://rapidapi.com/GeocodeSupport/api/forward-reverse-geocoding/).

I also made it using Typescript in an attempt to improve my knowledge of this language and of Javascript concepts in general.

<u>Instructions

  To run the app once downloaded, type 'npm run launch'. (You will need to install live-server package from npm -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)
  
  Note: Please make sure to generate and add a Rapid API key for the geocoding API where it is indicated in src/Geocoder.ts file. After that, compile the the file to js using npm run build.
